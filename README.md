# Cybersec_Internship_Task8
VPN Practice Exercise
This project documents hands-on experience using a free VPN (ProtonVPN) for privacy and encrypted communication.

What Was Done
Registered for ProtonVPN (free plan)

Downloaded and installed the VPN client on Windows

Connected to a VPN server and verified a new public IP

Ran internet speed tests before and after connection

Explored website browsing and email attachment behavior while connected

Studied core VPN features and privacy claims

Key Learnings
VPNs effectively hide your real IP address and encrypt internet traffic

Expect a drop in speed when using any VPN, especially free ones

VPNs add a strong privacy/security layer but are not a complete anonymity solution

Modern VPN providers like ProtonVPN implement protections against IPv6 and DNS leaks

Notes
Always verify connection status and new IP after connecting

Uncheck optional components during install if only the VPN service is needed

Email attachment security warnings are unrelated to VPN use
